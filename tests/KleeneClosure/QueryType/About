The experiments in this folder vary the selection strategy and predicates on the Kleene Closure part.
The meanings of parameters in the query name are as the following:
s2: partition-contiguity
s3: skip-till-next-match
p1: always true
p2: price should be increasing
p3: price should be larger than the minimum price of selected events
