Installation instructions 
=========================
Software Requirement
 * Install the Java Runtime Environment version 1.5.x or later

Configuration
(If you are using Windows, please install Cygwin first.)

Please follow the configuration steps below:
 * Unzip the package you downloaded
 * Set the SASE_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where the unzipped files are placed.
 * Add $SASE_HOME/build/sase.jar to the CLASSPATH
 * Add $SASE_HOME/lib/jeval.jar to the CLASSPATH.
 * Add $SASE_HOME/bin to the PATH to access all the executables.

Next you can run the sase.jar under the build/ folder by these commands:
 1. Test run 
 	The work directory is $SASE_HOME/build. Then use the following command to test the engine:
    
     "sase"
 
 2. Run with configurations  
 	The engine allows you to designate the query file and the stream file, and you can run the engine under any directory using the following command:

	"sase  Query_File Stream_File  Print_Result_Flag"
	
	The meanings of the parameters are explained as follows:

	- "Query_File"	 specifies the location of the query file, which is the full path of the file
	- "Stream_File"	 specifies the location of the config file for the stream generator, which is the full path of the file
	- "Print_Result_Flag"	 specifies whether or not to print the details of the result in the console. 1 for print, 0 for not print
